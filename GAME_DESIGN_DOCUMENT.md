## 🎯 Game Loop & Player Motivation

### Current Game Type: **Roguelike Photography Sim**

**Player motivation:** Discovery & urgency

---

### **Phase 2: Chase (10-60 seconds)**
**What happens:**

- Collect fuel to extend time

**Player motivation:**
- **Skill** - Timing, distance, aim duration
