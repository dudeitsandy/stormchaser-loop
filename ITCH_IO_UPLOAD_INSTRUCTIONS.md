# 🌪️ Stormchaser Loop

**Hotline Miami meets Twister - A 90-second tornado photography roguelike**

Chase tornados at 90 MPH, capture the perfect shot, and survive. Three progressive tornados per session. Each one faster and more dangerous than the last.

## 🎮 The Loop

**Watch** → **Warning** → **Chase** → **Photograph** → **Repeat** × 3

- Tornado watch alerts you
- Tornado spawns with TV warning
- Chase it across procedurally generated terrain
- Position yourself at perfect distance (risk vs reward)
- Hold aim for 2 seconds (watch crosshair turn green)
- SNAP! (📸 *incredibly satisfying*)
- Tornado hits edge of map and dissipates
- Wait 10-15 seconds for next tornado
- Final tornado moves at 2X SPEED!
- Session auto-ends after final tornado
