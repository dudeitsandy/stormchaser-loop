## ✅ Completed Enhancements

### 1. **Erratic Tornado Movement System**

**What Changed:**
- Tornados now have 4 distinct movement patterns that change every 8 seconds:
  - **Straight**: Normal linear movement to target
  - **Zigzag**: Side-to-side serpentine pattern
  - **Circular**: Loops and spirals
  - **Chaotic**: Random direction changes
- Speed variation: Tornados now speed up and slow down randomly (-30% to +50% speed)
- Pattern changes every 8 seconds for unpredictable behavior

**Code Changes:**
- `src/entities/Tornado.ts`:
  - Added movement pattern system
  - Added speed variation timer
  - Added `getErraticTarget()` method
  - More frequent strength changes (every 3 seconds vs 5)
  - More dramatic strength swings (0.3 to 5.0)

**Impact:**
- Tornados are much more unpredictable and challenging
- No two chases feel the same
- Requires constant adaptation from player

### 2. **Tornado Strength Changes with Visual Feedback**

**What Changed:**

- Weather alerts automatically update when EF rating changes
- Console logging for tracking strength changes

**Code Changes:**
- `src/scenes/Game.ts`:

3. **NPCs Fleeing**: Observe NPCs when tornado approaches
4. **Destruction**: Drive behind tornado, verify debris trail
5. **Strength Changes**: Wait for EF rating changes, verify screen flash

### Performance Testing
