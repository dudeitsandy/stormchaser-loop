# 🌪️ Stormchaser Loop

**What if Hotline Miami's tight gameplay loop met storm chasing photography?**

You're a storm chaser with a camera and 90 seconds. Chase down tornados, navigate treacherous terrain, and capture magazine-worthy shots while the clock ticks down. Each run is different. Each photo matters. Each second counts.

## 🎮 The Loop

**Chase** → **Photograph** → **Results** → **"One More Run"**

- Find the tornado (check your radar)
- Navigate procedurally generated terrain
- Position yourself at the perfect distance
- Aim for 2 seconds (watch the crosshair turn green)
- SNAP! (📸 *incredibly satisfying*)
- View your pixelated ground-level photos
- Beat your high score
- Immediately retry

## ⚡ Why You'll Keep Playing

**Easy to Learn:**
Drive with WASD, hold SPACE to aim, release to snap. You'll understand it in 15 seconds.

**Hard to Master:**
Perfect photos require perfect positioning, perfect timing, and perfect risk management. EF5 tornados at 70 MPH will test your limits.

**Highly Replayable:**
- Procedural terrain every run
- Dynamic tornado behavior (EF0-EF5)
- Photo quality scoring (Poor → Perfect)
- Short 90-second sessions
- Clear skill progression

## 🚗 Features

**Realistic Physics:**
- Vehicle maxes out at 90 MPH (like real chase trucks)
- Tornados move 15-70 MPH based on strength
- Highways = speed boost, mud = slowdown
- Collision damage scales with impact speed
- Speed-dependent turning

**Dynamic Tornados:**
- Strength changes mid-chase (EF1 → EF5)
- Animated spinning vortex with debris
- Danger zones (too close = death)
- Size and speed scale with intensity
- TV-style weather warnings

**Photography System:**
- Camera cone visualization
- Aim duration affects quality
- Distance affects score
- Tornado strength multiplies points
- See your shots rendered as pixelated ground views

**Procedural World:**
- Roads, highways, fields, forests, water, buildings
- Collision system (can't drive through trees)
- Terrain affects vehicle speed
- Minimap for navigation

**Retro Aesthetic:**
- Pixel art vehicles and effects
- Procedural sound effects (ZzFX)
- Atmospheric presentation
- TV news immersion

## 🎯 Strategy

**Risk vs Reward:**
- Close to strong tornado = huge points but dangerous
- Far from weak tornado = safe but low score
- Highway routes vs off-road shortcuts
- Health management vs score chasing

**Photo Mastery:**
- Quick snap = 50 points (poor)
- Perfect 2-second aim at EF5 = 500+ points!
- Distance matters (80-150 units optimal)
- Build your photo portfolio

## 🏆 Progression

**Beginner:** Learn controls, survive sessions, score 500-1500  
**Intermediate:** Get excellent photos, use terrain strategically, score 1500-4000  
**Advanced:** Perfect photos of EF4-5 tornados, score 4000-8000  
**Expert:** Multiple perfects per session, master routes, score 8000-15000+
