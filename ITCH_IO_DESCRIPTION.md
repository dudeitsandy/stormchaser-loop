# üå™Ô∏è Stormchaser Loop

**What if Hotline Miami's tight gameplay loop met storm chasing photography?**

You're a storm chaser with a camera and 90 seconds. Chase down tornados ranging from EF0 to EF5, navigate treacherous procedurally-generated terrain, and capture magazine-worthy shots while the clock ticks down. Each run is different. Each photo matters. Each second counts.

## üéÆ The Loop

**Chase** ‚Üí **Photograph** ‚Üí **Results** ‚Üí **"One More Run"**

- Weather alert pops - find the tornado (check your radar)
- Navigate procedurally generated terrain with realistic physics
- Position yourself at the perfect distance (danger vs reward)
- Hold aim for 2 seconds (watch the crosshair turn green)
- SNAP! (üì∏ *incredibly satisfying*)
- View your pixelated ground-level photos
- Beat your high score
- Immediately retry

## ‚ö° Why You'll Keep Playing

**Easy to Learn:**
Drive with WASD, hold SPACE to aim camera, release to snap. You'll understand it in 15 seconds.

**Hard to Master:**
Perfect photos require perfect positioning, perfect timing, and perfect risk management. EF5 tornados moving at 70 MPH will test your limits.

**Highly Replayable:**
- Procedural terrain every run (1,024 unique tiles)
- Dynamic tornado behavior that changes mid-chase (EF0‚ÜíEF5)
- Photo quality scoring (Poor ‚Üí Perfect)
- Short 90-second sessions
- Clear skill progression path
- Risk/reward decisions every second

## üöó What We Built

### Realistic Vehicle Physics
- Exponential acceleration (0‚Üí90 MPH in 8-10 seconds, just like real chase trucks)
- Speed-dependent turning (tight at low speed, wide arcs at highway speeds)
- Smooth 360¬∞ rotation with drift compensation for tight keyboard control
- Collision damage system (20-90 MPH impacts scale damage realistically)
- Terrain modifiers: Highways give 1.5√ó speed boost, mud slows to 0.4√ó
- Off-road acceleration penalties (harder to speed up in fields)

### Dynamic Tornado System
- Animated spinning vortex with debris particles
- EF0-EF5 rating system with realistic speeds (15-70 MPH)
- Strength changes mid-chase (that EF1 can become an EF5!)
- Visual size scaling with intensity
- Danger zones (too close = vehicle damage)
- Cloud formations and atmospheric effects
- Intelligent movement AI (prefers roads, avoids water)
- TV-style weather warnings when strength changes

### Photography Mechanic
- 45¬∞ camera cone visualization
- Hold-to-aim system: longer aim = better quality
- Color-coded crosshair feedback (red‚Üíorange‚Üíyellow‚Üígreen)
- 5 quality tiers: Poor, Decent, Good, Excellent, Perfect
- Distance affects score (80-150 units optimal)
- Tornado strength multiplies points
- Pixelated ground-level photo renderer
- Photo gallery on results screen (your top 3 shots)
- Different sound effects for each quality level

### Procedural World Generation
- Simplex noise-based terrain with 4 layers
- Multiple biomes: highways, roads, fields, forests, water, mud, buildings, trees
- Realistic terrain textures (road lane markings, crop rows, building windows)
- Collision system (buildings and trees block movement)
- 2400√ó1350 pixel world with 1,024 unique tiles
- Every session feels different

### TV News Immersion
- Picture-in-picture weather alerts (EF rating warnings)
- Flashing "LIVE" indicator
- Scrolling news ticker
- Emergency alert sounds
- Auto-dismiss or press X to close
- Professional broadcast aesthetic

### Complete UI Package
- Real-time HUD: Time, Score, Combo, Speed (in MPH), Health bar
- 150√ó150 minimap with live player/tornado tracking
- Camera aiming reticle with progress indicator
- Danger zone proximity warnings
- Clean, readable design with text strokes for visibility
- Debug panel (press ` for development info)

### Procedural Sound System (ZzFX)
- Satisfying camera shutter snap
- Quality-based photo feedback (different tones for Poor‚ÜíPerfect)
- Collision sounds scaled to crash severity
- Fuel/combo pickup sounds
- UI click feedback
- Weather alert emergency tone
- Victory fanfare (time expires)
- Game over tone (vehicle destroyed)
- Total file size: <1KB (all procedurally generated!)

### Pixel Art & Aesthetic
- Hand-designed title screen (pixel art car chasing tornado)
- Retro visual style throughout
- Atmospheric presentation
- Professional polish
- ¬© Ghostweave Games branding

## üéØ Strategy & Skill Progression

**Risk vs Reward:**
- Close to strong tornado = huge points but life-threatening
- Far from weak tornado = safe but low score
- Highway routes (fast) vs off-road shortcuts (risky)
- Health management vs score chasing
- Time extension pickups vs safety

**Photo Mastery:**
- Quick snap = 50 points (Poor quality)
- Perfect 2-second aim at EF5 = 500+ points!
- Distance matters (80-150 units optimal)
- Build your photo portfolio over sessions

**Progression Curve:**
- **Beginner:** Learn controls, survive sessions, score 500-1,500
- **Intermediate:** Get excellent photos, use terrain strategically, score 1,500-4,000
- **Advanced:** Perfect photos of EF4-5 tornados, score 4,000-8,000
- **Expert:** Multiple perfects per session, master routes, score 8,000-15,000+
