## üîß Quick Fixes Based on Feedback

### **If "Too Slow Performance"**
**Quick fix:** Reduce world size in `Game.ts`:
```typescript
// Change from 2400√ó1350 to 1600√ó900
this.physics.world.setBounds(0,0,1600,900)
```

### **If "Can't Find Tornado"**
**Quick fix:** Add arrow pointing to tornado (future)

### **If "Too Hard"**
**Quick fix:** Increase session time in `remote-config.json`:
```json
{ "sessionSeconds": 120 }
```

### **If "Too Easy"**
**Quick fix:** Increase tornado danger radius

### **If "Black Screen Still Happens"**
**Quick fix:** Share console errors with me for immediate fix
