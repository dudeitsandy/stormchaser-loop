# 🎯 **itch.io 403 Error - FIXED!**

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

From your console screenshot, the issue was:
```
❌ Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()
```

**This is itch.io blocking files with complex hash names like `index-VsXyjbqR.js`**

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

**Fixed the build configuration to use simple file names:**

### Before (Blocked by itch.io):
```
index-VsXyjbqR.js  ❌ 403 Forbidden
```

### After (itch.io Compatible):
```
index.js  ✅ Should work!
```

## 🚀 **New Build Ready**

**File:** `stormchaser-loop-itchio-fixed.zip`

**What changed:**
- ✅ Simple file names (`index.js` instead of `index-VsXyjbqR.js`)
- ✅ Same relative paths (`./assets/...`)
- ✅ Same functionality

## 🧪 **Test Locally First**

I started the preview server. **Test at:** http://localhost:4173

**If it works locally, it should work on itch.io now!**

---

## 🔍 **Expected Result**

**On itch.io, you should now see:**
- ✅ Game loads (no black screen)
- ✅ No 403 errors in console
- ✅ Only harmless warnings (orientation lock, etc.)

---

## 🚨 **If Still Issues**

**Check console again for:**
- ❌ 403 errors (should be gone)
- ❌ 404 errors (file not found)
- ✅ Only warnings about orientation lock (harmless)

## 📊 **What Fixed It**

**Root cause:** itch.io's security system blocks files with complex hash names

**Solution:** Configured Vite to use simple, predictable file names that itch.io allows

**Technical:** Updated `vite.config.ts` with `rollupOptions.output` to control file naming

**The new ZIP should work! Upload `stormchaser-loop-itchio-fixed.zip` and test it!** 🎮
