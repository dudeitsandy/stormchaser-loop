# 🌪️ Tornado Lifecycle System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete tornado lifecycle system with watches, warnings, progressive difficulty, and edge-of-map triggers.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Tornado Watch Phase** (0-5 seconds)
- Session starts with "TORNADO WATCH" ticker
- Warning that conditions are favorable for tornado development
- No tornado on screen yet
- Builds anticipation

### 2. **Tornado Lifecycle Management**
Each tornado follows this lifecycle:
1. **Warning** → Tornado spawns with alert
2. **Active** → Tornado moves around map
3. **Ended** → Tornado hits edge of map and dissipates
4. **Waiting** → Delay before next tornado (if applicable)

### 3. **Edge-of-Map Detection**
- Tornado ends when it gets within 100 units of world edge
- Automatic cleanup: destroys tornado, dismisses alerts
- Triggers next tornado spawn (if applicable)
- No more tornados floating off-screen!

### 4. **Progressive Difficulty System**

#### **Tornado #1** (First Tornado)
- **Spawn**: After 5-second watch period
- **Strength**: EF1-EF3 (moderate)
- **Movement**: Normal erratic patterns (8s pattern changes)
- **Speed**: 1x normal speed
- **Alert**: "TORNADO WARNING: EF? tornado has formed!"

#### **Tornado #2** (Second Tornado)
- **Spawn**: 10-15 seconds after first tornado ends
- **Strength**: EF2-EF4 (stronger)
- **Movement**: MORE erratic (4s pattern changes, forced chaotic/circular/zigzag)
- **Speed**: 1x normal speed with more variation
- **Alert**: "SECOND TORNADO WARNING: Multiple vortices reported!"
- **Ticker**: "EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION!"

#### **Tornado #3** (Final Tornado)
- **Spawn**: Based on remaining time (spawns with ~15s left minimum)
- **Strength**: EF3-EF5 (very strong)
- **Movement**: EXTREMELY erratic (2s pattern changes, always chaotic)
- **Speed**: **2X SPEED** (twice as fast as normal!)
- **Alert**: "FINAL TORNADO WARNING: LIFE THREATENING SITUATION!"
- **Ticker**: "THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE FOR PHOTOS!"

## 📊 Tornado Phases

```
WATCH → TORNADO 1 (Active) → ENDED → WAITING (10-15s) → 
TORNADO 2 (Active) → ENDED → WAITING (5-10s) → 
TORNADO 3 (Active) → ENDED → Session Complete
```

## 🎮 Gameplay Impact

### Risk & Reward
- **Damage is now working properly** - players take damage near tornado
- **Collision damage is working** - hitting buildings/NPCs damages player
- **Each tornado is more dangerous** than the last
- **Final tornado is extremely challenging** (2x speed, EF5 strength)

### Progressive Challenge
- Session starts easy (watch phase, moderate tornado)
- Builds to medium difficulty (second tornado more erratic)
- Climaxes with extreme challenge (final tornado super fast)

### Session Variety
- Three distinct tornado encounters per session
- Different behavior patterns for each
- Clear escalation of difficulty
- Multiple opportunities for photos

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Game State Variables
```typescript
tornadoCount: number          // Which tornado (1, 2, 3)
tornadoPhase: string          // 'watch', 'warning', 'active', 'ended', 'waiting'
nextTornadoTimer: number      // Countdown to next spawn
nextTornadoDelay: number      // How long to wait
```

### New Tornado Properties
```typescript
speedMultiplier: number       // External speed boost (2.0 for final tornado)
```

### Key Methods
- `spawnNextTornado()` - Spawns tornado with progressive difficulty
- `endTornadoEvent()` - Cleans up and schedules next spawn
- `setSpeedMultiplier()` - Makes tornado faster

## 🎯 Damage System Fixed

### Tornado Proximity Damage
- ✅ Damage scales with distance and tornado strength
- ✅ Up to 25 damage/second at EF5 center
- ✅ Visual feedback (camera shake)
- ✅ Audio warnings (alert sounds)
- ✅ Debug logging (occasional, not spammy)

### Collision Damage
- ✅ Buildings/trees damage player based on speed
- ✅ NPC collisions cause minor damage (2 HP)
- ✅ Speed-based damage scaling
- ✅ Visual/audio feedback

### Health System
- ✅ Health reduces properly
- ✅ Death triggers when health reaches 0
- ✅ Visual health bar updates in real-time
- ✅ No more debug spam in console

---

## 📱 User Experience

### Clear Communication
- **Watch Alert**: "Conditions favorable for tornado development"
- **Warning Alert**: Shows EF rating when tornado spawns
- **Edge Event**: "Tornado has moved out of the area"
- **Next Tornado**: "Radar shows another storm system developing"

### Visual Feedback
- **White flash** when tornado spawns (dramatic)
- **Red flash** when tornado intensifies
- **Camera shake** when taking damage or in strong wind
- **Dust particles** in wind

### Audio Feedback
- **Alert sounds** when tornado spawns
- **Alert sounds** when taking damage
- **Alert sounds** when strength changes

## 🌪️ Tornado Behavior Summary

| Tornado | Spawn Time | Strength | Speed | Pattern Changes | Difficulty |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| #1 | 5s (watch) | EF1-3 | 1x | Every 8s | Moderate |
| #2 | 10-15s after #1 | EF2-4 | 1x | Every 4s | High |
| #3 | Based on time | EF3-5 | **2x** | Every 2s | Extreme |

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

1. ✅ Tornado going off minimap → Now ends at edge
2. ✅ Tornado not respawning → Now spawns up to 3 times
3. ✅ Damage not working → Fixed, now applies properly
4. ✅ Console spam → Reduced debug logging
5. ✅ Health check every frame → Removed spam

### Test 1: Complete Session
1. Watch phase (0-5s)
2. Tornado #1 spawns
3. Chase and photograph

5. Wait 10-15s
6. Tornado #2 spawns (more erratic)
7. Chase and photograph
8. Tornado hits edge
9. Wait for final tornado

11. Final chase
12. Session ends

### Test 2: Proximity Damage

2. Verify damage is applied
3. Check health bar decreases
4. Verify death at 0 HP
